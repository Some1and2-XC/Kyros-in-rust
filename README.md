# Kyros in Rust - A Fractal Generator
## Description
 - This project is designed to be a rewrite of the python Kyros project but in rust. 
 - The goal of this project is to get performace wins over the python alternative which is using the numba function precompiler. 
## Updates
 - As I improve in rust, this project will evolve and hopefully someday be even better than the python version.
